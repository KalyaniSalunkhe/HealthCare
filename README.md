## üè• Healthcare Database SQL Queries

### üìò Project Overview

This repository houses a comprehensive suite of SQL queries tailored for managing and analyzing data within a relational healthcare database. The queries span various facets of hospital operations, including patient care, staff management, room assignments, appointments, and medical procedures. The primary objective is to provide efficient data retrieval and reporting capabilities for healthcare administrators, clinicians, and researchers.

### üîë Key Features

* **Patient Management**: Retrieve patient information, appointment details, and treatment histories.
* **Staff Management**: Access data related to physicians, nurses, and other healthcare staff, including roles and certifications.
* **Room and Facility Management**: Monitor room availability, block and floor assignments, and on-call nurse scheduling.
* **Medical Procedures and Prescriptions**: Track medical procedures, prescribed medications, and associated costs.
* **Affiliations and Certifications**: Manage physician department affiliations and training certifications.

```

#### 3. Count of Available Rooms in Each Block

```sql
SELECT blockcode, COUNT(*) AS available_rooms
FROM room
WHERE unavailable = 'f'
GROUP BY blockcode;
```

#### 4. Patients and Their Treating Physicians

FROM patient p
INNER JOIN appointment ap ON p.ssn = ap.patient
INNER JOIN physician phy ON ap.physician = phy.employeeid;
```

#### 5. Nurses Assigned to Room 122

```sql
SELECT n.name AS nurse_name
FROM nurse n
INNER JOIN on_call o ON n.employeeid = o.nurse
INNER JOIN room r ON o.blockfloor = r.blockfloor AND o.blockcode = r.blockcode
WHERE r.roomnumber = 122;
```
